FORMATIVE ASSIGNMENT: ADVANCED LINEAR ALGEBRA (PCA)

This is a group assignment that covers three core parts:

**Part 1: PCA Implementation from Scratch**

Implemented **Principal Component Analysis** manually using:

Covariance matrix computation
Eigendecomposition (eigenvalues & eigenvectors)
Data projection onto principal components
Dynamic selection of components based on explained variance
Used a real **Africanized dataset** with more than 10 features.
Optimized code for **large datasets**.
All implementation was done in the provided **Google Colab notebook in the PCA Folder**.



**Part 2: Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Analysis**

Analyzed a specific 4Ã—4 matrix:

Found all eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Explained the variance (%) each eigenvalue contributes
Each group member was assigned to calculate one eigen value and its eigen vector
**Handwritten calculations** were done collaboratively, scanned, and submitted as a single **PDF**.

**Part 3: PyPi Library Creation**

 Developed a custom matrix operation library: alumathunique

Supports matrix multiplication of any valid shape
Published to PyPi with documentation
Included instructions on how to install and use the package.
